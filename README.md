I have developed a URL_Shortner web application using pyshorteners module in Python and Django framework.

Working :
 - Give a long URL like, https://linkedin.com
 - Use this tool you can get the URL shortened, and can copy and this shortened URL for the same URL you have given and it'll be work any where.
